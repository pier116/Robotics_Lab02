command to ssh to laptop: ssh -Y 10.194.16.44

- started roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch already, looks good
- you can monitor hardware status with rqt -s kobuki_dashboard, which brings up a gui that shows whats going on
	* bringing both of those commands up at the same time show the status of all hardware, all says "OK"


roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch 

roslaunch p1_world turtle_main.launch
